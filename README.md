# Personal Website
Check out my personal website [here](https://christian-doucette.github.io/)!

I am also using this site for a couple small in-browser projects made with Javascript:
1. [Tic-Tac-Toe Bot](https://christian-doucette.github.io/tic_tac_toe/tic_tac_toe.html)
2. [Typer](https://christian-doucette.github.io/typer/typer.html)
3. [Base Coverter](https://christian-doucette.github.io/converter/converter.html)
