    <h3>The Goal</h3>
    <p>
      My 2021 New Year's resolution is to read every night before bed, even if just a few pages.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal of this is to:
      <ol>
        <li>Get me to read more books this year</li>
        <li>Help me to get better sleep by not using screens directly before sleeping</li>
        <li>And most importantly, to build a lasting habit of reading before bed</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      So far this year, I've read <i>Seveneves</i>, <i>The Code Book</i>, and <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>. Check out my reviews below.
    </p>

    <h3>Books So Far</h3>

    <div class="card mt-3 mb-5">
      <h5 class="card-header"><i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> by Dale Carnegie</h5>
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">
          <i style="font-size:20px; color:#FDCC0D;" class="fa">&#xf005;</i>
          <i style="font-size:20px; color:#FDCC0D;" class="fa">&#xf005;</i>
          <i style="font-size:20px; color:#FDCC0D;" class="fa">&#xf005;</i>
          <i style="font-size:20px; color:#FDCC0D;" class="fa">&#xf005;</i>
        </h5>
        <p class="card-text"><i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> describes strategies for working more effectively with others.</p>
        <p class="card-text"><i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> was a really helpful read for me. Each chapter discusses a tip or strategy for dealing more effectively with people. Many of the strategies discussed were totally new to me. Others seem obvious, but are still worth reiterating. And, all are backed up with psychological explanations and examples to demonstrate their effectiveness.</p>
        <p class="card-text"> I also liked that the book was not focused on manipulating people, despite how the title makes it sound. People being able to communicate, share ideas, and work together more effectively benefits everyone.<p>
        <p class="card-text">Some of the more obvious takeaways (but still important to reiterate):
          <ul>
            <li>The best way to be interesting to people, and to be a goood conversationalist, is to be geniunely interested in what they have to say</li>
            <li>Harsh criticism or getting angry at someone (even if they deserve it) will just make them defensive, and will never make them change their mind</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">Some of the less obvious takeaways:
          <ul>
            <li>People like an idea more if they feel like they contributed to creating it</li>
            <li>People love others saying their name, so using that frequently can help to make a good impression on someone</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="card-text">Overall, I really liked <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>, and definitely plan on using the strategies from it in my daily life.</p>

    <div class="card mb-5">
      <h5 class="card-header"><i>The Code Book</i> by Simon Singh</h5>
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">
          <i style="font-size:20px; color:#FDCC0D;" class="fa">&#xf005;</i>
          <i style="font-size:20px; color:#FDCC0D;" class="fa">&#xf005;</i>
          <i style="font-size:20px; color:#FDCC0D;" class="fa">&#xf005;</i>
          <i style="font-size:20px; color:#FDCC0D;" class="fa">&#xf005;</i>
          <i style="font-size:20px; color:#FDCC0D;" class="fa">&#xf005;</i>
        </h5>
        <p class="card-text"><i>The Code Book</i> is a brief history of cryptography, with some explanation of the mathematics of cryptography. It begins with descriptions of simple ciphers, and ends with speculation on the future of cryptography in a world with quantum computing.</p>
        <p class="card-text"><i>The Code Book</i> is my favorite book of the year so far. The history of cryptography is extremely interesting, and Singh brings up lots of important moments in history that hinged on whether a specific cipher could be broken. These important historical events give <i>The Code Book</i> a surprising amount of suspense. The descriptions of the math behind cryptography are very good, and do a great job of providing intuition and pros/cons without getting lost in the weeds.</p>
        <p class="card-text">I especially enjoyed the section on World War 2 cryptography. At that time, communications used radio, meaning that all communcations could be intercepted, and that cryptography was more important than ever before. It was also interesting to see how the codebreaking effort in World War 2 led to some of the earliest computers, and some of the foundational ideas in computer science.</p>
        <p class="card-text">I also really enjoyed the chapter <i>The Language Barrier</i>, which discussed applications of cryptography to the decipherment of ancient languages such as the Minoan Linear B script. This challenge should not be underrated: the Navajo code-talker cipher, based on communicating using the Navajo language, was one of the only WW2 ciphers that was never broken!</p>

        <p class="card-text">Some interesting takeaways:
          <ul>
            <li>An encryption system is only as strong as its weakest link. This means that even a system that is mathematically unbreakable can still be vulnerable, if it is not used properly.</li>
            <li>Cryptography is a thankless job. Many great cryptographers never recieved recognition for their work, or it was only declassified decades later.</li>
            <li>The difficulty with creating laws about cryptography is that any unbreakable system for personal privacy could also be used for crime and terrorism. And any backdoor for law enforment necessarily creates exploitable vulnerabilities.</li>

          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">Overall, I highly recommend <i>The Code Book</i> to anyone! I look forward to reading <i>Fermat's Enigma</i>, a book by Simon Singh about Fermat's Last Theorem sometime later this year.</p>

    <div class="card mb-5">
      <h5 class="card-header"><i>Seveneves</i> by Neal Stephenson</h5>
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">
          <i style="font-size:20px; color:#FDCC0D;" class="fa">&#xf005;</i>
          <i style="font-size:20px; color:#FDCC0D;" class="fa">&#xf005;</i>
          <i style="font-size:20px; color:#FDCC0D;" class="fa">&#xf005;</i>

          <i style="font-size:20px; color:#FDCC0D;" class="fa">&#xf089;</i>
        </h5>
        <p class="card-text"><i>Seveneves</i> is a science fiction book split into two parts. The first part is about humanity attempting to leave earth to escape an extinction event, and the second part is about the descendents of the survivors returning to repopulate the Earth, thousands of years later.</p>
        <p class="card-text"><i>Seveneves</i> is a great sci-fi novel with amazing world-building. One unique thing about it: because it was split into two parts with a five thousand year time jump, it had some great realistic, near future sci-fi as well as some great unrealistic, far-future sci-fi, both in the same book.</p>
        <p class="card-text">In the first part, humanity had to quickly turn the ISS into a self-sustaining ship that would allow a few hundred humans to escape Earth. I liked the realistic challenges it brought up in making this happen, like how to guarantee that the ISS could avoid asteroids, how to ensure genetic diversity for future generations, and how to allocate resources so that it could sustainably support life in the long term. Additionally, the feeling it was interesting to see how people reacted to what was essentially the end of the world.</p>
        <p class="card-text">It was also interesting to see the continuities from the first part into the second part, and how the events of the first influenced the future culture and technology of humanity in the second. </p>
        <p class="card-text">Overall, I recommmend <i>Seveneves</i> if you are looking for a sprawling sci-fi book with an emphasis on world building.</p>
