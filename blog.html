    <h3>The Goal</h3>
    <p>
      My 2021 New Year's resolution is to read every night before bed, even if just a few pages.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal of this is to:
      <ol>
        <li>Get me to read more books this year</li>
        <li>Help me to get better sleep by not using screens directly before sleeping</li>
        <li>And most importantly, to build a lasting habit of reading before bed</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Check out the books I've read so far this year below!

    <h3>Books So Far</h3>
    <div class="card mt-3 mb-5">
      <h5 class="card-header"><i>Born to Run</i> by Christopher McDougall</h5>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text"><i>Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen</i> is a book about the Tarahumara, a tribe in Mexico that is specializes at ultramarathon running. The book is a great mix of running/training tips, crazy stories about ultramarathon races, and glimpses into the fascinating culture of the Tarahumara. Central to all of it is the inspiring idea that humans are biologically meant to excel at long distance running.</p>
        <p class="card-text"><medium class="text-muted">"If you don't think you were born to run you're not only denying history. You're denying who you are."</medium></p>

    <div class="card mt-3 mb-5">
      <h5 class="card-header"><i>Stories of Your Life and Others</i> by Ted Chiang</h5>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text"><i>Stories of Your Life and Others</i> is a collection of science fiction short stories. Since the author has a computer science background, they involved a lot of cool ideas from math and compter science like Universal Turing Machines or GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems. My favorite stories are:
          <ul>
            <li><i>Division by Zero</i>, about a mathematician who makes a startling discovery about the nature of pure mathematics</li>
            <li><i>Story of Your Life</i>, about a linguist whose brain is altered by learning an alien language</li>
          </ul>
          I really enjoyed it, and highly recommend.

    <div class="card mb-5">
      <h5 class="card-header"><i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> by Dale Carnegie</h5>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text"><i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> describes strategies for working more effectively with others. Some of the strategies were totally new to me, others were common sense but still good to emphasize becuase of their importance. Carnegie persuasively argues for the effectivess of these tactics, backing them up with psychological explanations and examples of them in action.</p>

    <div class="card mb-5">
      <h5 class="card-header"><i>The Code Book</i> by Simon Singh</h5>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text"><i>The Code Book</i> is a history of cryptography, with some explanations of the mathematics of cryptography. I loved this book and highly recommend it. The historical anecdotes were really interesting, especially the section on the codes and codebreaking efforts of World War 2. It also did a great job of explaining the huge influence that cryptography has had and the ways that it will shape our world in the future.</p>

    <div class="card mb-5">
      <h5 class="card-header"><i>Seveneves</i> by Neal Stephenson</h5>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text"><i>Seveneves</i> is a scifi book about humanity attempting to leave earth to escape an extinction event, and the descendents of the survivors returning to repopulate the Earth thousands of years later. I loved the worldbuilding of this book, as will as a lot of the realistic challenges it brought up, such as differing strategies for avoiding asteroids, and how to ensure genetic diversity for future generations.</p>
